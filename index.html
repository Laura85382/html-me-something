        <li>The stop in St. George at the Dino Track museum was a complete fluke.  Saw a sign and stopped.  Awesome little museum.</li>
        <li>The Natural History Museum in Salt Lake City is the best one I have ever visited (and nerd alert - I have been to quite a few.)</li>
        <li>The kids were thrilled to play in a little patch of snow at Bryce Canyon National Park.</li>
        <li>My daughter puked at the Nationl Dinosaur Monument (bad hot dog).</li>
        <li>There was a McDonalds right next to the Dino museum in Fruita, CO.  Not sure which one the kids were more excited about.</li>
        <li>One of the best pictures of the trip, was all seven kids sitting in rocking chairs in front of a shop in the Ghost town.</li>
        <li>There were no crowds on our trip, as our school district had different Spring Break week then the Utah schools.</li>
        <li/>My daughter, in her "I set my own style" manner, wore the same crazy hat everyday.</li>
        <li>The kids qualified as "Junior Rangers" at all three National Parks!</li>
        <li>In the little downtime we had, played board games, swam at the hotel pool and even saw a movie.</li>
